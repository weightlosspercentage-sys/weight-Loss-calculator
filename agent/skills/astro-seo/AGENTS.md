# Astro SEO — Implementation recipes

Detailed code recipes for Phase 2 (Improve). Read this file when you need to implement a specific fix flagged by the audit. The parent `SKILL.md` has the workflow and audit checklist.

## Install or upgrade `@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph`

If not installed:

```sh
npm install @jdevalk/astro-seo-graph
```

If installed but behind the latest npm version (checked in Phase 0):

```sh
npm install @jdevalk/astro-seo-graph@latest
```

Read the package's [changelog](https://github.com/jdevalk/seo-graph/blob/main/packages/astro-seo-graph/CHANGELOG.md) between the installed and latest version before upgrading — new defaults may need explicit opt-out if the project relied on old behavior.

**1.0.0 migration note.** `<Seo>` is now a first-party component (drops the `astro-seo` dep) and `buildAstroSeoProps` / the `AstroSeoProps` type were removed. If the project called `buildAstroSeoProps` directly, migrate to `buildSeoContext` (returns a flat `SeoContext`). Sites using `<Seo>` through the normal prop interface need no code change — the upgrade also fixes three silent bugs (`articlePublisher` now renders, canonical no longer leaks on `noindex` pages, single `og:image` and single `<meta name="robots">` per page).

## Integration config

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import seoGraph from '@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph/integration';

// Only submit to IndexNow on the production host. Local `npm run build`
// and preview deploys should not ping the endpoint with URLs the host
// hasn't served yet — that gets the key rejected (403) and forces rotation.
const isProductionBuild =
    process.env.CF_PAGES === '1' && process.env.CF_PAGES_BRANCH === 'main';
    // Vercel: process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production'
    // Netlify: process.env.CONTEXT === 'production'

export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://example.com',
    integrations: [
        seoGraph({
            validateH1: true,
            validateUniqueMetadata: true,
            validateImageAlt: true,
            validateMetadataLength: true,
            validateInternalLinks: {
                // ≥ 1.1.1 recognises non-HTML files from public/ as valid
                // link targets automatically. `skip` is still useful for
                // SSR-only routes, wildcards, and `[slug]` params.
                skip: (href) => href.startsWith('/api/'),
            },
            ...(isProductionBuild && {
                indexNow: {
                    key: process.env.INDEXNOW_KEY,
                    host: 'example.com',
                    siteUrl: 'https://example.com',
                },
            }),
            llmsTxt: {
                title: 'Example',
                siteUrl: 'https://example.com',
            },
            // Emit <link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown"> on every
            // page. Only enable once `createMarkdownEndpoint` is wired at
            // the matching path (see § Markdown alternates below),
            // otherwise the link 404s. Requires ≥ 1.2.0.
            markdownAlternate: true,
        }),
    ],
});
```

## `BaseHead.astro`

Replace whatever head metadata the project has with a single `<Seo>` call. The component handles title, description, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter, JSON-LD graph, and extra links in one place.

## Content collection schema

```ts
// src/content/config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';
import { seoSchema } from '@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph';

export const collections = {
    blog: defineCollection({
        schema: ({ image }) => z.object({
            title: z.string(),
            excerpt: z.string(),
            publishDate: z.coerce.date(),
            seo: seoSchema(image).optional(),
        }),
    }),
};
```

## Per-collection sitemap + git lastmod

Import `gitLastmod` from `@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph` (≥ 1.4.0) — don't hand-roll it. The export skips bulk commits (imports, reformats, mass renames) via `excludeCommits`, which a plain `git log -1` can't do, and returns `null` cleanly when git is unavailable so the caller can fall back to `publishDate`.

```js
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';
import { gitLastmod } from '@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph';

// Short SHAs of bulk commits that shouldn't count as content updates.
const BULK_COMMITS = ['52130a9', '989dc47'];

function urlToSourceFile(url) {
    // map the public URL back to the markdown file that produced it
    const slug = new URL(url).pathname.replace(/^\/blog\/|\/$/g, '');
    return `src/content/blog/${slug}/index.md`;
}

sitemap({
    entryLimit: 1000,
    chunks: {
        posts: (item) => isBlogPost(new URL(item.url).pathname) ? item : undefined,
    },
    serialize: (item) => {
        const last = gitLastmod(urlToSourceFile(item.url), { excludeCommits: BULK_COMMITS });
        if (last) item.lastmod = last.toISOString();
        return item;
    },
});
```

`gitLastmod` shells out to `git`, so it only runs at build time on Node — not in browser bundles or edge runtimes. Resolve `filePath` relative to the build CWD. The same export feeds `dateModified` on JSON-LD pieces if you need consistent "updated" dates across sitemap and schema.

## OG image route

The goal: every page has a 1200×675 JPEG OG image with a deterministic URL derived from the slug, generated at build time. No manual upload step, no runtime rendering.

**Pick the renderer.**

- **Text-heavy cards** (title + subtitle + site name over a solid or gradient background) — use [`satori`](https://github.com/vercel/satori) to render JSX/HTML to SVG, then [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) to rasterize to JPEG. This is the common case. Satori doesn't support every CSS feature — stick to flexbox, basic typography, absolute positioning.
- **Photo-heavy cards** (hero image with a title overlay) — skip satori. Use `sharp`'s composite pipeline: load the hero from `public/`, resize to 1200×675, composite an SVG overlay for the title band, encode JPEG. Faster and avoids satori's CSS limits.

**Build-time route vs. build script.**

A route at `src/pages/og/[...slug].jpg.ts` that runs in `getStaticPaths` is the cleanest fit for Astro: one file, colocated with the content, no external build step, per-page URLs just work. Use a standalone Node build script that writes to `dist/og/` only when you need to share the renderer across sites or run it outside Astro. Default to the route.

**Fonts.**

Satori needs font buffers, not CSS. Commit a `woff2` (or TTF — satori accepts both) under `src/fonts/` and read it with `fs.readFileSync` at build time. For text that might contain glyphs the primary font doesn't cover (CJK, emoji, extended Latin), pass multiple fonts in the `satori({ fonts: [...] })` array — satori falls back through them in order. Don't rely on system fonts; the build environment won't have them.

**Localized sites.**

Include the locale in the slug (`/og/en/<slug>.jpg`, `/og/nl/<slug>.jpg`) and resolve per-locale strings (site name, tagline) inside the route. If the primary font doesn't cover the target language, add a locale-appropriate fallback font to the `fonts` array before rendering.

**Minimal satori route sketch:**

```ts
// src/pages/og/[...slug].jpg.ts
import satori from 'satori';
import sharp from 'sharp';
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

const font = fs.readFileSync('src/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2');

export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const posts = await getCollection('blog');
    return posts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.slug }, props: { post } }));
}

export async function GET({ props }) {
    const svg = await satori(
        {
            type: 'div',
            props: {
                style: { /* flex, padding, colors, etc. */ },
                children: [/* title + subtitle nodes */],
            },
        },
        { width: 1200, height: 675, fonts: [{ name: 'Inter', data: font, weight: 700, style: 'normal' }] }
    );
    const jpg = await sharp(Buffer.from(svg)).jpeg({ quality: 90 }).toBuffer();
    return new Response(jpg, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg' } });
}
```

Wire the URL into `<Seo>` as the `openGraph.image` value.

**If the project already has an OG route,** verify: output is 1200×675 JPEG (not WebP/AVIF/PNG — social platforms don't all support those), the URL is deterministic from the slug, and the route runs at build time (not SSR on request — that's a per-crawl cost).

## Schema endpoints and schema map

Each endpoint collects every entry in a content collection, builds the JSON-LD graph per entry, and serves the combined result as `application/ld+json`. Don't hand-write the mapper — the full implementation with entity builders (`buildWebPage`, `buildArticle`, etc.) and their expected arguments is documented in the [`astro-seo-graph` schema endpoints docs](https://github.com/jdevalk/seo-graph/tree/main/packages/astro-seo-graph#schema-endpoints). Copy from there. Then add `/schemamap.xml` listing every endpoint, and a `Schemamap:` directive in `robots.txt`.

## `llms.txt`

Pass an options object to `llmsTxt` on the `seoGraph()` integration (requires `@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph` ≥ 0.9.0). Required fields: `title` (the H1 for the file) and `siteUrl` (used to resolve crawled HTML paths). Optional: `summary` (rendered as a blockquote), `details` (extra paragraphs), `sections` (user-supplied sections; when given, no pages are auto-collected), `filter` / `autoSectionName` / `outputPath` to tune the auto-generated output. For rendering outside the integration hook, import `renderLlmsTxt` from the package.

## Markdown alternates

Serve clean markdown copies of every page at a parallel `.md` URL for AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cloudflare's crawlers) to consume without HTML parsing. Requires `@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph` ≥ 1.2.0; ≥ 1.3.0 adds build-output verification of the discovery link. Two pieces:

1. **The route.** Create `src/pages/[...slug].md.ts` (or whatever path shape you need) and export `createMarkdownEndpoint`. It serves a YAML frontmatter block (title, canonical, pubDate, updatedDate, author, description, tags, categories) followed by the markdown body, with `Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8`, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`, `X-Markdown-Tokens: <n>`, and a `Link: <canonical>; rel="canonical"` header pointing crawlers back at the HTML. Token count defaults to `chars/4`; swap in `gpt-tokenizer` or `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` via `estimateTokens` for accuracy. **Slug-match guard required** in the `mapper`: return `null` when `post.id !== slug`, otherwise the first entry whose mapper returns non-null wins for *every* URL — a silent 200-with-wrong-content bug.
2. **The discovery link.** Set `markdownAlternate: true` on the `seoGraph()` integration (see the integration config above). `<Seo>` will emit `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" href="…">` on every page, derived from the canonical (`/blog/post/` → `/blog/post.md`). **Only turn this on after the route is wired** at the matching path — otherwise the link 404s. ≥ 1.3.0 walks the build output and strips any link whose target `.md` isn't on disk (with a per-occurrence `warn`), so misconfigured endpoints surface as build warnings instead of shipped 404s. SSR users whose `.md` endpoints aren't prerendered should leave this off and emit the link themselves — the verification will otherwise strip every link.

**Content negotiation on a static host.** On Cloudflare Pages, add a Transform Rule that rewrites `Accept: text/markdown` requests to the `.md` path. Use `wildcard_replace` (free plan) — `regex_replace` is paid-only. **Don't add a `Vary: Accept` response-header rule:** Cloudflare strips custom `Vary` values at the edge, and the URL rewrite already separates cache entries per content type. Trailing-slash canonical URLs use `wildcard_replace(http.request.uri.path, "*/", "${1}.md")`; extensionless non-trailing-slash URLs need a separate rule that matches `not ends_with(…, "/")` and rewrites with `concat(http.request.uri.path, ".md")`. The `astro-seo-graph` README has the full rule config; copy from there.

For rendering outside the route, import `renderMarkdownAlternate` — pure renderer, same frontmatter + body + token-count output. For callers building their own pipelines, ≥ 1.3.0 also exports `findMarkdownAlternateLink`, `stripMarkdownAlternateLink`, and `resolveMarkdownAlternatePath` (the same primitives the post-build verifier uses).

## API catalog

`@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph` ≥ 1.4.0 ships `createApiCatalog`, an Astro route factory that returns RFC 9727 `application/linkset+json`. Drop it at `src/pages/.well-known/api-catalog.ts`:

```ts
import { createApiCatalog } from '@jdevalk/astro-seo-graph';

export const GET = createApiCatalog({
    siteUrl: 'https://example.com',
    schemaEndpoints: [
        { path: '/schema/post.json', schemaType: 'BlogPosting', serviceDoc: '/seo-graph/' },
        { path: '/schema/page.json', schemaType: 'WebPage', serviceDoc: '/seo-graph/' },
    ],
    schemaMap: { path: '/schemamap.xml', serviceDoc: '/seo-graph/' },
    additional: [
        { anchor: '/ask', serviceDoc: '/ask/', type: 'https://schema.org/SearchAction' },
        { anchor: '/feed.xml', type: 'https://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' },
    ],
});
```

Schema endpoints get auto-typed to `https://schema.org/<schemaType>` URLs; `additional` is for site-specific APIs where you supply `anchor`, optional `serviceDoc`, and optional `type` (single string or `string[]`). Relative paths are absolutized against `siteUrl`. The factory also exports `CATALOG_PATH` (`/.well-known/api-catalog`) for use in `_headers` Link entries (see § Link headers).

If the project still has a hand-written `api-catalog.ts` returning JSON literally, replace it. The factory removes the duplication where adding a schema endpoint required updating the catalog by hand.

## Content Signals in robots.txt

Add a `Content-Signal:` directive declaring AI training, search grounding, and AI input preferences independently of crawl access. The spec is an [IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-romm-aipref-contentsignals/), but adoption costs one line in a file every site already has.

Common policies:

- "Public corpus, anything goes": `Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes`
- "Indexable but not for training": `Content-Signal: ai-train=no, search=yes, ai-input=yes`
- "Search only, no AI": `Content-Signal: ai-train=no, search=yes, ai-input=no`

The directive sits alongside `User-agent` rules. If `robots.txt` is generated from a route (`src/pages/robots.txt.ts`), append the line to the response body. Don't gate this on user-agent; it applies site-wide.

## MCP and A2A discovery cards

Only publish these if the site actually exposes the corresponding endpoint. They're static JSON files in `public/.well-known/`.

**MCP server card** at `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` per [SEP-1649](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2127):

```json
{
    "name": "example-mcp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "transport": { "type": "streamable-http", "url": "https://example.com/mcp" },
    "capabilities": { "tools": true, "resources": false, "prompts": false }
}
```

**A2A agent card** at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` per the [A2A protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/):

```json
{
    "name": "example-agent",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "skills": [
        {
            "id": "ask",
            "name": "Ask",
            "description": "Answer questions about the corpus",
            "service_endpoint": "https://example.com/ask"
        }
    ]
}
```

Add CORS headers in `_headers` so cross-origin agents can fetch them:

```text
/.well-known/*
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
```

Wire both into the sitewide `Link` header (next section).

## ARD catalog and OKF bundle

Both are v0.9 drafts — optional, not recommended. Publish ARD once the site has more than one agent-facing surface worth listing; publish an OKF bundle when the content collection is worth shipping as a packaged knowledge base.

**ARD catalog** ([Agentic Resource Discovery](https://agenticresourcediscovery.org/)) — a static JSON file at `public/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` listing the domain's agent-facing resources. Each entry carries **both** `type` and `mediaType` with the same value: the base spec ([`Agent-Card/ai-catalog`](https://github.com/Agent-Card/ai-catalog)) reads `mediaType`, the ARD layer ([`ards-project/ard-spec`](https://github.com/ards-project/ard-spec)) reads `type`, and both ignore unknown keys, so the dual-field entry validates either way. `representativeQueries` is an optional array of sample prompts.

```json
{
    "version": "0.9",
    "entries": [
        {
            "name": "OKF bundle",
            "type": "application/okf-bundle+gzip",
            "mediaType": "application/okf-bundle+gzip",
            "url": "https://example.com/okf.tar.gz",
            "representativeQueries": ["What does this site document?"]
        },
        {
            "name": "MCP server",
            "type": "application/json",
            "mediaType": "application/json",
            "url": "https://example.com/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

**OKF bundle** ([Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog)) — a tree of typed Markdown concept files (one per page, paths mirroring canonical URLs) plus index files, served as a single `okf.tar.gz`. Generate it as one more output of the build that already produces sitemap / llms.txt / markdown alternates, not a second copy to keep in sync. There is **no registered media type yet**; ship `application/okf-bundle+gzip` as a single documented constant marked interim (tracked in [knowledge-catalog#111](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/issues/111) and [ard-spec#27](https://github.com/ards-project/ard-spec/issues/27)). Reuse the same CORS / cache `_headers` block as the other `.well-known` files, and add the catalog to the sitewide `Link` header (next section) as `rel="ai-catalog"`.

## Link headers for agent discovery

A single `Link` header on `/*` consolidates the discovery surface: sitemap, llms.txt, api-catalog, schemamap, and any MCP / A2A cards. Agents reading response headers don't have to load HTML to find any of them.

**Cloudflare Pages / Netlify.** Append to `public/_headers`:

```text
/*
  Link: </sitemap-index.xml>; rel="sitemap", </llms.txt>; rel="alternate"; type="text/plain", </.well-known/api-catalog>; rel="api-catalog", </schemamap.xml>; rel="schemamap"
```

Append `, </.well-known/mcp/server-card.json>; rel="mcp-server-card"` and `, </.well-known/agent-card.json>; rel="agent-card"` if those cards exist.

**Vercel.** Set in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
    "headers": [
        {
            "source": "/(.*)",
            "headers": [
                { "key": "Link", "value": "</sitemap-index.xml>; rel=\"sitemap\", </llms.txt>; rel=\"alternate\"; type=\"text/plain\", </.well-known/api-catalog>; rel=\"api-catalog\", </schemamap.xml>; rel=\"schemamap\"" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Only list resources the site actually serves. A `Link` entry pointing at a 404 is worse than no entry.

## RSS feed

If no feed exists, add `@astrojs/rss`:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/rss
```

Create `src/pages/feed.xml.ts` that pulls the blog collection and renders full post bodies (not excerpts) — truncated feeds frustrate readers and give AI agents less to work with. Advertise the feed in the `<Seo>` component's `extraLinks` with `rel="alternate"` and `type="application/rss+xml"`.

## Redirects and FuzzyRedirect

Seeding `_redirects` from scratch is the unpleasant part. Practical approach:

- If migrating from WordPress or another CMS, export the old URL list from the source (WP-CLI `wp post list`, database dump, or the old sitemap via Wayback Machine).
- Diff old URLs against the current sitemap; every URL in the old set not in the new set needs a redirect entry.
- Commit the table once, maintain it going forward whenever you change a slug.

Syntax depends on the host:

- **Cloudflare Pages / Netlify:** `public/_redirects` — `/old-path /new-path 301` per line.
- **Vercel:** `vercel.json` with a `redirects` array.
- **Other hosts:** server config (nginx, Apache, etc.).

Then add `<FuzzyRedirect>` to the 404 page. Confirm the 404 page returns a 404 status, not 200 — platform-specific behavior, check the deployed response.

## Performance headers

Syntax depends on the host. Pick the one matching Phase 0's detected deployment target.

**Cloudflare Pages / Netlify** — `public/_headers`:

```text
/_astro/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/*
  No-Vary-Search: key-order, params=("utm_source" "utm_medium" "utm_campaign" "utm_content" "utm_term")
```

**Vercel** — `vercel.json`:

```json
{
    "headers": [
        {
            "source": "/_astro/(.*)",
            "headers": [{ "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }]
        },
        {
            "source": "/(.*)",
            "headers": [{ "key": "No-Vary-Search", "value": "key-order, params=(\"utm_source\" \"utm_medium\" \"utm_campaign\" \"utm_content\" \"utm_term\")" }]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Other hosts** — configure equivalents in server config; syntax varies.

## Broken link checker in CI

Add a [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action) workflow at `.github/workflows/link-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Link Check
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/content/**'
      - 'src/pages/**'
      - '*.md'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly, Mondays 09:00 UTC — catches link rot
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2
        with:
          args: --no-progress './**/*.md' './**/*.astro' './**/*.mdx'
          fail: true
```

Push-triggered runs block broken links from shipping. The weekly run catches external link rot.
