# Closed-Loop Capture (Layer 1)

How to make the learnings loop *close itself* — automatic capture after every
session, on **any laptop**, across **Claude Code and Codex**. This is the
runtime-hook upgrade the main SKILL.md gestures at under "Related Skills →
agents-hooks".

## Why this exists

The base loop (the `## Learnings Loop` addendum + `append_learning.py`) is
**open**: it depends on a human remembering to append. Open loops decay — in
practice the raw `learnings.md` files stay near-empty. Layer 1 closes the
*capture* half: a session-end hook detects which wired skills were used, asks
one cheap model pass whether there was a durable learning, and appends it via
the existing `append_learning.py`. No new memory format; no `SKILL.md`
rewrite. Layer 2 (scheduled consolidation) remains manual and is out of scope
here. Layer 3 (eval-gated promotion) is now built as a human-triggered gate —
see `references/promotion-protocol.md` — but is not part of this capture hook.

## The three-part model

| Closure | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Capture** | session-end hook → reflect → `append_learning.py` | **this doc** |
| Consolidate | scheduled `consolidate.py` (dreaming-style) | manual |
| Promote | eval-gated `promote_learning.py` (discriminating regression eval) | **built, human-triggered** (`references/promotion-protocol.md`) |

Build capture first: without traces there is nothing to consolidate or gate.

## One script, two registrations

Claude Code and Codex both deliver `{session_id, transcript_path, cwd, …}` on
stdin to a session-end hook, so the logic is identical and the script is
runtime-neutral. Only the registration file differs:

| Runtime | Config file | Event | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `$HOME/.claude/settings.json` | `SessionEnd` | fires **once** per session |
| Codex CLI | `$HOME/.codex/hooks.json` | `Stop` | Codex has **no** `SessionEnd`; `Stop` may fire **per turn** |

Because Codex `Stop` can fire per turn, the script keeps a per-`(session_id,
skill)` marker (`$HOME/.agents/hooks/.seen/`) with a bounded retry count
(`MAX_ATTEMPTS=3`): at most one reflection per skill per session, whether the
host fires once (Claude) or many times (Codex). Markers older than 7 days are
pruned automatically.

The script lives at `$HOME/.agents/hooks/learnings_capture.py` — a
runtime-neutral location both agents can share (the OpenClaw `~/.agents`
convention). Source of truth is `assets/learnings_capture.py` in this skill.

## Install on any laptop

```bash
# From this skill directory:
python3 scripts/install_capture_hook.py --dry-run   # preview
python3 scripts/install_capture_hook.py             # apply
```

The installer resolves every path from `Path.home()` at run time — **no
username is ever hardcoded**. It is idempotent and re-runnable: it copies the
script to `$HOME/.agents/hooks/`, registers Claude Code (`settings.json` is
created if absent), and registers Codex **only if Codex is present** (`~/.codex`
exists or `codex` is on `PATH`) — re-run after installing Codex to add it.
Unrelated keys and other hooks are preserved; a prior registration of this
script is replaced, not duplicated.

Uninstall: `python3 scripts/install_capture_hook.py --uninstall`.

## Skills-root discovery (portability)

The script must find the repo to know which skills are wired and where
`append_learning.py` is. Resolution order:

1. `LEARNINGS_SKILLS_ROOT` env var (explicit override — set this in CI or
   non-standard layouts).
2. Common `$HOME`-relative layouts (`Documents/Code/AI-Agents/…`,
   `Documents/AI-Agents/…`, `AI-Agents/…`, `projects/…`, `code/…`,
   `.agents/skills`).

A candidate counts only if it actually contains
`agents-skills-feedback-loop/scripts/append_learning.py`. If none match →
silent no-op + a log line telling you to set `LEARNINGS_SKILLS_ROOT`. On a
laptop with a non-standard checkout path, set that env var in your shell
profile.

## Guardrails (why this is safe machine-global)

- **Recursion guard.** The reflection call (`claude -p`) is itself an agent
  session whose end re-enters the hook. The script exits at line 1 if
  `CLOSED_LOOP_HOOK_ACTIVE=1`, which it sets before spawning the model. Without
  this, a machine-global hook is a fork bomb. Verify this first on any change.
- **Blast-radius limit.** These hooks run in *every* repo on the machine. The
  transcript parse is the gate: no wired skill used → silent `exit 0`, no
  model call, no cost. Most sessions hit this.
- **Fail-silent, fail-logged.** Always `exit 0` (session-end hooks must not
  block). Every decision is written to
  `$HOME/.agents/hooks/learnings_capture.log`. **That log is the
  capture-rate gauge** — `session=… wired=N appended=M` is the loop's only
  measurement. Read it to know the loop is alive.
- **Capability-agnostic.** No `claude` CLI / no hook runtime → no-op, never an
  error. The manual `append_learning.py` path always still works.

## Verifying it works

It is self-instrumenting by design because three things are **not** verifiable
without a real session: (1) live `claude -p` reflection quality, (2) that the
host actually fires the hook with `matcher:"*"`, (3) the real transcript JSONL
schema (both runtimes warn the format is *not* a stable interface). One log
line triages all three:

```bash
cat ~/.agents/hooks/learnings_capture.log
```

- no new line after a session that used a wired skill → hook/matcher didn't
  fire (#2)
- `wired=0` after such a session → transcript schema differs here (#3); the
  parser fails silent, so fix `skills_used()` against a real transcript sample
- `wired≥1 appended=0` repeatedly → live model step misbehaving (#1)

## Testing without burning model calls

Set `LEARNINGS_REFLECT_CMD` to a stub that reads the prompt on stdin and
prints `SECTION|||text` (or `SKIP`). Point `LEARNINGS_SKILLS_ROOT` at a temp
fixture. This exercises detection → dedupe → append deterministically with no
`claude` call — the recommended pre-deploy check on any new machine.

## Anti-patterns

- Hardcoding an absolute home path in the repo (breaks on the next laptop) —
  always reinstall via the installer instead.
- Using Claude Code's `Stop` event for capture — it fires after *every*
  response, not at session end. Claude Code uses `SessionEnd`; Codex uses
  `Stop` because it has no `SessionEnd`.
- Auto-rewriting `SKILL.md` from captured learnings. Capture only appends raw
  bullets; promotion stays human-reviewed (see main SKILL.md Anti-Patterns).
