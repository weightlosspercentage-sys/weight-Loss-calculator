description: "Create complete Claude Code workflow directories with curated skills. Use when user wants to (1) create a new workflow for specific use case (media creator, developer, marketer, etc.), (2) set up a Claude Code project with pre-configured skills, (3) download and organize skills from GitHub repositories, or (4) generate README.md and AGENTS.md documentation for workflows. Triggers on phrases like \"create workflow\", \"new workflow\", \"set up workflow\", \"build a xxx-workflow\"."

# Workflow Creator

Create complete workflow directories with curated skills downloaded from GitHub.

## Workflow Creation Process

### Step 1: Create directory structure

Run `scripts/create_workflow.py` to initialize:

```bash
python scripts/create_workflow.py <workflow-name> --path <output-dir>
```

Creates (with multi-AI tool support):
```
workflows/<workflow-name>-workflow/
├── README.md          # User documentation (English)
├── README_cn.md       # User documentation (Chinese)
├── AGENTS.md          # AI context (auto-loaded)
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── skills/        # Skills go here (primary storage)
├── .codex/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .cursor/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .opencode/
│   └── skill -> ../.claude/skills
├── .agents/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .kilocode/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .roo/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .goose/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .gemini/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .agent/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .github/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── skills -> .claude/skills
├── .factory/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
└── .windsurf/
    └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
```

Symlinks enable all AI tools to use the same skills from .claude/skills/.

### Step 2: Select and download skills

1. Use the **Skill Sources** section below to find relevant skills
2. Download each skill using `scripts/download_skill.py`:

```bash
python scripts/download_skill.py <repo-url> <skill-path> --output workflows/<workflow-name>/.claude/skills/
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Official Anthropic skills
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/anthropics/skills skills/docx --output ./workflows/media-workflow/.claude/skills/

# Community skills (root level)
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/gked2121/claude-skills social-repurposer --output ./workflows/media-workflow/.claude/skills/
```

### Step 3: Generate README.md (English)

**CRITICAL: Follow the exact format from `workflows/marketing-pro-workflow/README.md`**

Required structure:
```markdown
<div align="center">

# 📋 Workflow Name

### **Your AI-Powered [Domain] Team**

[← Back to AI Workflow](../../README.md)

[简体中文](./README_cn.md) | English

</div>

## 🔗 Skill Combinations

## 📄 License

```

Use `assets/templates/README.template.md` as reference.

### Step 4: Generate README_cn.md (Chinese)

Create Chinese version with:
- Same structure as English README
- Professional Chinese terminology
- Link back to `../../README_cn.md`

### Step 5: Generate AGENTS.md

Write AI instructions covering:
- Workflow overview with pipeline diagram
- Available skills grouped by stage
- Skill usage guidelines (when to use each)
- Recommended sequences for common tasks
- Output standards
- Quality gates between phases

**Important:** AGENTS.md is auto-loaded by Claude Code. Keep it concise (<500 lines) and focused on actionable instructions.

Use `assets/templates/AGENTS.template.md` as reference.

### Step 6: Update project README

After creating a workflow in the ai-workflow project, update:

1. **README.md** (English):
   - Add new workflow to the workflow table
   - Add skills list under `<details>` section
   - Update skill count (e.g., "150+ skills")

2. **README_cn.md** (Chinese):
   - Same updates in Chinese
   - Link to `README_cn.md` in workflow folder

### C. Search Strategy

When the above sources lack needed skills:

1. **GitHub Search**: `"claude" "skills" "SKILL.md" <topic>`
2. **agent-skills.md Search**: Browse by tags at https://agent-skills.md/tags
3. **SkillsMP Search**: Filter by category at https://skillsmp.com
4. **Validate**: Check SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`

### D. Download Commands

```bash
# From GitHub repository
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> <skill-path> --output workflows/<workflow-name>/.claude/skills/

# Example: Download from alirezarezvani
python scripts/download_skill.py https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills skills/content-creator --output ./workflows/content-creator-workflow/.claude/skills/
