# Western Tropical — interpretation ruleset

Tropical zodiac (tied to the seasons), psychological/archetypal focus. The engine
returns planets with `sign`, `deg_in_sign`, `house`, `retrograde`, `dignity`, plus
houses, aspects, and element/modality balance. Read it in this order.

## 1. The Big Three (start here, always)
- **Sun** = core identity, conscious will, what you're growing *into*. The sign's element/modality is the engine of the personality.
- **Moon** = emotional nature, instinct, what you need to feel safe, the inner child and the mother.
- **Rising / Ascendant** = the mask, the body, first impressions, the lens you meet life through. Sets the whole house framework.

A person is the **dialogue** between these three. Sun in fiery Aries with Moon in
watery Cancer and Libra rising = a warrior who needs emotional safety and presents as
a diplomat. Name that negotiation.

## 2. Planets = the cast
| Planet | Archetype | Reads as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mercury | mind, voice | how you think, learn, speak (check if near Sun = combust/intense) |
| Venus | love, value | what you find beautiful, how you love and attract, money taste |
| Mars | drive, anger | how you act, fight, desire; your raw engine |
| Jupiter | expansion, luck | where you grow, your faith, your excess |
| Saturn | discipline, fear | where you're tested, mature slowly, build mastery through limitation |
| Uranus | disruption | where you're a rebel/genius, sudden change (generational) |
| Neptune | dreams, dissolution | where you idealise, escape, or attune spiritually (generational) |
| Pluto | power, rebirth | where you transform through crisis and confront the shadow (generational) |
| N/S Node | growth axis | North = unfamiliar growth edge; South = innate gift to release |
| **Chiron** | wounded healer | your deepest wound (the sign/house it's in) that becomes your greatest teacher — the gift emerges *through* the wound, not despite it |

**Chiron in brief** — Chiron transits one sign every 2–8 years (very eccentric orbit; fastest near Virgo/Libra, slowest near Pisces/Aries). Its natal sign describes the *wound-theme* of a generation; its natal **house** personalises which life arena the wound plays out. Chiron in a natal chart is often most powerful when a transit or progressed planet makes a hard aspect to it. The classic Chiron reading: the house it occupies is where the person *cannot help others most powerfully* — because it's where they bled first.

## 3. Sign qualities
- **Elements**: Fire (spirit/action), Earth (matter/practicality), Air (mind/relation), Water (emotion/intuition). The engine gives the element & modality balance — a chart lacking an element craves it; an over-loaded element runs the show.
- **Modalities**: Cardinal (initiates), Fixed (sustains/resists), Mutable (adapts/scatters).
- Each sign's keywords (incl. the shadow) are in the engine's data and `SIGN_DATA`.

## 4. Houses (life arenas) — engine uses whole-sign
A planet's **house** says *where in life* its energy plays out (1=self, 2=money,
7=partners, 10=career… full list in engine `HOUSE_MEANINGS`). Sign = *how*; house =
*where*. The ruler of each house's sign links arenas together (e.g. 2nd-house ruler in
the 9th = money through travel/teaching/publishing).

## 5. Aspects = the wiring (the chart's drama)
Engine returns aspects sorted by tightness (smaller orb = stronger). Read the tightest
3–5 first; they define the person.
- **Conjunction (0°)** — fusion; the two planets act as one.
- **Trine (120°) / Sextile (60°)** — ease, talent, flow (trine can be lazy; sextile needs effort to cash in).
- **Square (90°)** — friction that *drives*; the chart's growth engine, felt as inner conflict.
- **Opposition (180°)** — a see-saw, usually projected onto other people until owned.
- **Quincunx (150°)** — chronic awkward adjustment between unrelated drives.

Synthesise aspects, don't list them: a Sun–Saturn square is "you had to earn your own
authority the hard way, and you're harder on yourself than anyone."

## 6. Dignity (a planet's strength)
The engine tags `domicile/rulership`, `exalted`, `detriment`, `fall`. A planet in
domicile or exalted acts cleanly and strongly; in detriment/fall it's strained and
needs conscious work. Mention it when it sharpens the read.

## 7. Retrogrades
Natal retrograde (engine `retrograde:true`) = that planet's energy turns *inward* /
reworks itself (Mercury Rx: thinks before speaks, non-linear mind). Not "bad."

## 8. Timing — transits & the great cycles (use `mode:"transit"`)
- **Saturn Return (~age 29, 58)** — the structural reckoning; adulthood demands you build what lasts. The single most-asked-about transit.
- **Jupiter Return (~every 12 yrs)** — a door of growth/opportunity opens.
- **Uranus Opposition (~age 40–42)** — the "mid-life" awakening: authenticity vs. the built life.
- **Nodal Return (~18.6, 37, 56)** — karmic re-orientation of direction & relationships.
- Transiting **Saturn/Jupiter/Pluto** aspects to natal planets time the major chapters; the engine lists the tightest. Always name **when a hard transit eases** — that timeline is the relief people came for.

## 9. Health in the Western chart
Health questions map to the **6th house** (chronic habits, daily body maintenance), **1st house/Ascendant** (vitality, constitution), and **8th house** (crises, surgery, transformation). Specific indicators:
- **Saturn** in the 6th or afflicting the Ascendant ruler → chronic conditions, structural/skeletal issues, need for discipline in body maintenance.
- **Mars** in the 6th or 8th → inflammation, fever, accidents; read the sign for which body system (Aries=head, Taurus=throat, etc.).
- **Chiron's house** → the arena where chronic wounding lives (often psychosomatic); also the theme the person eventually heals *in others*.
- **12th house** → hidden health undermines; hospitals, immune/sleep issues.
- Always name the **path through** (concrete habits that help) — never predict disease as a fixed outcome.

### The zodiac-anatomy map (deep medical astrology)
Each sign rules a body region; the engine's `ANATOMY` table gives the full
mapping. The body systems and regions most emphasised in a chart are the ones
the person should consciously maintain:

- **Aries** — head, brain, eyes, adrenals (nervous / acute inflammation)
- **Taurus** — neck, throat, thyroid, jaw (lymphatic)
- **Gemini** — lungs, shoulders, arms, hands, peripheral nerves
- **Cancer** — chest, breasts, stomach, womb (digestion, fluids, the emotional barometer)
- **Leo** — heart, upper back, spine, circulation
- **Virgo** — abdomen, intestines, spleen (digestive, hygiene, routine)
- **Libra** — kidneys, lower back, adrenals, skin
- **Scorpio** — reproductive organs, bladder, pelvis (eliminative, sexual)
- **Sagittarius** — hips, thighs, liver, sciatic nerve
- **Capricorn** — knees, bones, joints, teeth, skin
- **Aquarius** — ankles, calves, circulation, the electrical system
- **Pisces** — feet, immune system, the psyche

### Surgery timing — the most actionable rule
**Avoid elective surgery when the Moon transits the sign ruling the body part.**
- Throat → avoid Moon in Taurus · Heart → avoid Moon in Leo · etc.
- Avoid the **lunar eclipse** window (2 weeks before/after) for elective procedures
- Prefer **Moon in a fixed sign** (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) for stable outcomes
- **Waning Moon** preferred for surgery (less vital force bleeding out)
- **Mars afflicting Moon or Asc ruler** = higher risk of complications; defer
The engine's `anatomy_chart(planets_block)` flags afflicted regions and the surgery-avoidance rule.

### Diet & lifestyle by chart (classical guidance)
- **Aries / Mars-prominent** → cooling diet, less red meat, rhythmic exercise
- **Taurus / Venus-prominent** → slow sensual eating; watch the throat (salt, sugar, voice)
- **Gemini / Mercury-prominent** → light varied meals; the breath and the lungs are the barometer
- **Cancer / Moon-prominent** → warm cooked food; the gut is the emotional barometer
- **Leo / Sun-prominent** → aerobic exercise; warming spices
- **Virgo / Mercury-prominent** → simple whole foods; routine is the medicine
- **Libra / Venus-prominent** → balance; the kidneys and skin
- **Scorpio / Mars-Pluto-prominent** → cleansing; reproductive and eliminative systems
- **Sagittarius / Jupiter-prominent** → variety and outdoors; the liver thrives on movement
- **Capricorn / Saturn-prominent** → discipline; bones and joints need weight-bearing and minerals
- **Aquarius / Uranus-Saturn-prominent** → rhythm and rest; circulatory and nervous
- **Pisces / Neptune-Jupiter-prominent** → the immune and the psyche; the body is porous to environment

### The ethical frame
**Astrology complements but never replaces medicine.** Use the engine to read
the *timing* and the *vulnerability map*. A real diagnosis comes from a real
doctor. The agent must be unequivocal: "your chart suggests watching X;
please see a qualified practitioner for any actual symptoms."

## 10. Electional astrology (deeper than the synastry file)

For "when should I do X?", Western electional rules:
- **Identify the house that rules the matter** (7=marriage, 10=career, 2/8=finance, 5=children/creativity).
- **Find a day when the relevant planet is strong and unafflicted** (Venus for marriage, Jupiter for career, Mercury for contracts).
- **Avoid Mercury retrograde** for any signing, launching, or starting-from-scratch.
- **Avoid lunar eclipses** for almost all beginnings.
- **Favour benefics on the relevant point**: Moon in a friendly sign, Jupiter trine or sextile the Ascendant, Venus well-placed.
- **Void-of-course Moon** = do not initiate anything significant. Wait.
- For **moving house** → Moon in a fixed sign (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) for stability.
- For **surgery** → see §9 above.

For Vedic muhurta rules (Pushya, Rohini, Hasta nakshatras; Rahu Kalam avoidance; weekday + hora combinations), see `specialty-systems.md §3`.

## 11. Lost-object guidance (when the question is "where is my ___?")

For simple lost-object questions, the agent can run a quick horary chart
(`mode:"horary"`) and read the 4th house:
- **Fire sign on 4th** → near heat (kitchen, fireplace), high places, east-facing rooms
- **Earth sign on 4th** → on the ground, in storage, in soil or wood, low shelves
- **Air sign on 4th** → where air moves (windows, vents), on paper, in books
- **Water sign on 4th** → near water (sink, bathroom), in containers, dark damp places

**Moon's last separating aspect** before changing sign = direction relative to
where you are now. The querent still has to walk through the space — the chart
gives the *element and direction*, not the exact GPS. Be honest about this
limit; the level of specificity a real "where is it?" question needs is
beyond any chart.

## Reading recipe
1. State the Big Three as a living negotiation.
2. Name the dominant element/modality and what it makes the person *do*.
3. Pull the 2–3 tightest aspects → the central paradox.
4. Locate it in houses (which life arenas light up).
5. If timing was asked: overlay current transits + the cycle they're in.
6. End with the growth edge (North Node) and one concrete action.
7. **Health reading**: map to 1st/6th/8th/12th, name the Saturn/Mars/Chiron indicators, give the constructive habit — never the diagnosis.
8. **Surgery timing**: use `anatomy_chart` to flag afflicted regions; the rule is "no elective surgery when Moon is in the sign of the body part."
9. **Electional question**: identify the ruling house, find candidate dates, rule out Mercury Rx / lunar eclipse / VoC Moon, give 2-3 ranked windows.
10. **Lost-object question**: run `mode:"horary"`, read the 4th-house element + Moon's last aspect; frame as guidance, not GPS.
