# CI/CD & Deployment

## Overview

Covers CI/CD pipeline design, deployment platform selection, and production infrastructure. Focuses on GitHub Actions with hardened security (OIDC, permission scoping, action pinning), Bun-first build optimization, and deployment patterns from MVP to enterprise scale.

**When to use:** Setting up GitHub Actions workflows, choosing deployment targets, configuring OIDC for cloud providers, optimizing CI performance, planning multi-environment pipelines.

**When NOT to use:** Application-level architecture decisions (use framework-specific skills), Kubernetes cluster management (use dedicated IaC tools), cloud provider console configuration.

## Quick Reference

| Need                      | Solution                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MVP deploy (< 1K users)   | Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Cloudflare Pages          |
| Growing product (1K-100K) | AWS Amplify, Cloud Run, Fly.io, Render              |
| Enterprise (100K+)        | AWS ECS/EKS, GKE, DigitalOcean App Platform         |
| Static site               | Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages                   |
| Full-stack + DB           | Railway, Render, AWS Amplify                        |
| Global low latency        | Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Fly.io             |
| Compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2) | AWS, GCP, Azure                                     |
| Cloud auth from CI        | OIDC roles (never long-lived keys)                  |
| Action pinning            | Pin to commit SHA, not tag                          |
| Bun CI caching            | `~/.bun/install/cache` keyed on lockfile            |
| Pipeline security         | StepSecurity Harden-Runner for egress control       |
| Container builds          | Multi-stage Dockerfile: builder + runtime stage     |
| Docker layer caching      | `--cache-from` + `actions/cache` for buildx         |
| Multi-platform builds     | `docker buildx` targeting `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` |
| Image scanning            | Trivy or Snyk in pipeline before push               |
| Registry push             | GHCR (`ghcr.io`), ECR, Docker Hub                   |
| Pipeline stages           | build → test → security scan → deploy               |
| DORA: deploy frequency    | Track deployments per day/week per service          |
| DORA: lead time           | Commit-to-production time; target < 1 hour          |
| DORA: change failure rate | % of deploys causing incidents; target < 5%         |
| DORA: MTTR                | Mean time to restore; target < 1 hour               |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                   | Correct Pattern                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storing long-lived AWS/GCP/Azure keys as GitHub secrets   | Use OIDC roles with `id-token: write` permission for zero-trust cloud auth           |
| Pinning GitHub Actions to tags instead of commit SHAs     | Pin third-party actions to full commit SHA to prevent supply chain attacks           |
| Leaving `permissions` as default (broad) on workflows     | Explicitly scope permissions at the job level; default to `contents: read`           |
| Running full CI on every branch push                      | Use `on.pull_request` filters and path-based triggers to avoid wasted compute        |
| Over-engineering infrastructure before product-market fit | Start with managed platforms (Vercel, Railway); scale to AWS/GKE only when needed    |
| Using outdated action versions (v3 or older)              | Use current major versions: checkout@v6, cache@v5, configure-aws-credentials@v5      |
| Caching only `bun.lockb` without considering `bun.lock`   | Bun 1.2+ uses text-based `bun.lock`; hash whichever lockfile format the project uses |
| Skipping preview deployments for PRs                      | Every PR should get a preview URL for testing before merge                           |

## Relationship to Other Skills

> If the `github-actions` skill is available, delegate detailed workflow authoring, matrix strategies, and composite actions to it. This skill covers CI/CD architecture and platform selection; `github-actions` covers workflow syntax depth.
> If the `deployment-strategy` skill is available, delegate deployment pattern selection (blue-green, canary, rolling) to it. This skill covers platform selection and CI pipeline mechanics.

## Delegation

- **Audit existing CI workflow security and permissions**: Use `Explore` agent to scan workflow YAML files for broad permissions, unpinned actions, and exposed secrets
- **Set up multi-environment deployment pipelines**: Use `Task` agent to create dev/staging/prod workflows with environment protection rules
- **Plan migration from managed platform to containerized infrastructure**: Use `Plan` agent to evaluate current deployment, define migration steps, and select target architecture
