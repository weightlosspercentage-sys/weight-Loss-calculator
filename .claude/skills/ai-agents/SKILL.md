# AI Agents Development — Architecture Hub

Use this skill to decide whether a workflow should be an agent, which agent shape fits, which protocol boundary to use, and what production controls must exist before rollout.

Default posture: explicit control flow, bounded tools, typed contracts, auditable state, human approval for high-risk actions, and telemetry from day one.

Keep this file lean. Load detail from [`references/index.md`](references/index.md), `assets/`, and sibling skills only when needed.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- agent architecture or operating-model decisions
- build-vs-not-agent assessment
- MCP vs A2A protocol choice
- production readiness review for an existing agent system
- evaluation, observability, rollout, or safety planning
- framework selection after requirements are already clear
- a starting template for a new agent spec
- graph engineering, agent/workflow graphs, state-machine orchestration, cyclic graphs, or DAG-versus-loop design
- loop engineering, run-until-done coding agents, self-improving workflows, evaluator feedback loops, or bounded autonomous iteration
- uncertainty over whether a "graph" means execution control flow, an improvement network, or a knowledge/context graph

## Default Workflow

1. Run the build-vs-not decision gate.
2. Define the task environment: performance measure, environment, percepts/sensors, actions/tools, observability, determinism, time horizon, and single-agent vs multi-agent interaction.
3. Choose control flow; default to workflow/FSM/DAG for production.
4. Choose protocol boundaries: MCP for tools/data, A2A for agent handoffs.
5. Define contracts: tool schemas, handoff payloads, state model, success criteria.
6. Add evaluation and telemetry before shipping.
7. Add human approval, rollback, and kill-switches for irreversible actions.
8. Start from templates, then route to specialized skills for implementation depth.

## ASCII Flow

```text
Agent-system request
  -> Build-vs-not gate
     +-- simpler workflow/form/tool fits -> do not build an agent
     +-- autonomy justified              -> continue
  -> Define task environment and performance measure
  -> Choose control flow: workflow, FSM, DAG, or agent loop
  -> Set boundaries: MCP for tools/data, A2A for handoffs
  -> Define state, schemas, success criteria, and approvals
  -> Add evals, telemetry, rollback, and kill switches
  -> Route implementation depth to specialized skills
```

## Known Traps

- treating "agent" as the default interaction pattern when a workflow, form, or plain tool call would be simpler
- using MCP as the overall agent architecture instead of the tool and resource integration layer
- adding long-term memory without provenance (A13), retention policy, correction flow (A11 — forget path), and user-value proof. Use [`ai-context-layer/patterns-catalog.md`](../ai-context-layer/references/patterns-catalog.md) to pick a named pattern and [`ai-context-layer/anti-patterns-catalog.md`](../ai-context-layer/references/anti-patterns-catalog.md) for the sweep
- letting planner loops recurse without explicit step, budget, and escalation limits
- shipping autonomous actions before evaluator coverage, rollback controls, and human approval paths exist
- defaulting to a multi-agent topology for reasoning-heavy work when a single strong model at an equal token budget matches or beats it — under a fixed reasoning-token budget, message-passing between agents loses mutual information vs. full-context conditioning (Data Processing Inequality). Confirm the task is genuinely parallelizable or tool/role-diverse before fanning out. (arXiv:2604.02460, Apr 2026 preprint — not peer-reviewed; scope: text-only multi-hop reasoning; verify before relying.)

## Common Anti-Patterns

- chat-first agent design with no state model, contract, or action boundary
- multi-agent topologies introduced before single-agent failure modes are understood
- tool surfaces defined by convenience rather than least privilege
- evaluation added after launch as observability theater instead of a release gate
- provider or framework selection driven by hype, benchmark screenshots, or marketing taxonomy alone

## Quick Reference

| Question | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Should this be an agent? | Start with [`references/build-vs-not-decision.md`](references/build-vs-not-decision.md); default answer is "no" until volume, ambiguity, and value justify autonomy. |
| What is the task environment? | State the performance measure, environment, percepts/sensors, actions/tools, observability, determinism, horizon, and other agents before choosing a framework. |
| Which control flow fits? | Prefer workflow/FSM/DAG; use planner/executor only when branching cannot be modeled explicitly. |
| MCP or A2A? | MCP for external tools/data, A2A for agent-to-agent coordination, both when a multi-agent system also needs tools. |
| When to use multi-agent? | Only when roles, handoff contracts, and verifier responsibilities are explicit. |
| When to add long-term memory? | Only with provenance, retention rules, user consent, and clear value. Pick a named pattern from [`ai-context-layer/patterns-catalog.md`](../ai-context-layer/references/patterns-catalog.md) (P2 for app-orchestrated, P3 for self-editing, P4 for temporal, P6 for conversational). Run the anti-pattern sweep — A1 (no raw transcripts), A11 (forget path required), A13 (provenance mandatory). |
| What must exist before rollout? | Eval suite, telemetry, action limits, human escalation, rollback path, and kill switch. |
| Is this "graph engineering" or "loop engineering"? | Start with [`references/graph-and-loop-engineering.md`](references/graph-and-loop-engineering.md); identify the graph's purpose before selecting a runtime or datastore. |

## Autonomy Shapes — How to Host an Agent 24/7

Three deployment shapes for running agents continuously. Pick by the **trigger model**, not by the framework.

| Shape | Trigger | When to use | Primary guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Triggered / hosted run** | Webhook, queue, schedule, `/fire` | Per-event agent work, scheduled jobs, fan-out from external sources | [`../ai-coding-agents-tasks/references/webhook-and-queue-triggers.md`](../ai-coding-agents-tasks/references/webhook-and-queue-triggers.md) + [`../ai-coding-agents-tasks/references/durable-trigger-integration.md`](../ai-coding-agents-tasks/references/durable-trigger-integration.md) |
| **B — Always-on bot / voice server** | Sessions, WebSocket, SIP call | Support / sales / voice bots with conversational state | [`../ai-bot-builder/references/production-deployment.md`](../ai-bot-builder/references/production-deployment.md) + [`../ai-bot-builder/references/stateful-rollout-and-blue-green.md`](../ai-bot-builder/references/stateful-rollout-and-blue-green.md) + [`../ai-voice-bots/references/production-deployment.md`](../ai-voice-bots/references/production-deployment.md) |
| **C — Autonomous loop** | PRD + loop driver until acceptance met | Long-horizon work: refactors, migrations, research, Ralph-Loop class | [`references/autonomous-loop-patterns.md`](references/autonomous-loop-patterns.md) |

Cross-shape requirements:

- **Budget and kill-switch enforcement**: [`../agents-hooks/references/budget-and-loop-hooks.md`](../agents-hooks/references/budget-and-loop-hooks.md)
- **24/7 operating model (SLOs, on-call, runbooks)**: [`references/24-7-operating-model.md`](references/24-7-operating-model.md)
- **Provider failover and secret rotation**: [`../ai-bot-builder/references/secret-rotation-and-model-fallback.md`](../ai-bot-builder/references/secret-rotation-and-model-fallback.md)
- **Where to host (Vercel / Fly.io / Railway / Cloudflare / Render)**: [`../software-paas-hosting/SKILL.md`](../software-paas-hosting/SKILL.md) and [`../software-paas-hosting/references/agent-hosting-matrix.md`](../software-paas-hosting/references/agent-hosting-matrix.md)

## Architecture Selection

| Need | Default Agent Shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic business process | Workflow agent | Best default for auditable production behavior. |
| Bounded external actions | Tool-using agent | Keep tools narrow, typed, and permission-scoped. |
| Knowledge-grounded answers | RAG agent | Require citations, ACL-aware retrieval, and refusal on missing evidence. |
| Long multi-step work with branching | Planner/executor | Use strict step budgets, checkpoints, and replanning limits. |
| Specialized roles with explicit ownership | Multi-agent orchestrator | Handoffs are APIs; add verifier/evaluator roles early. Score the design against the MAST failure taxonomy — do not re-derive it: [`../agents-subagents/references/mast-failure-taxonomy.md`](../agents-subagents/references/mast-failure-taxonomy.md) (14 modes; original Cemri et al. distribution ≈ Specification/System Design 41.8% / Inter-Agent Misalignment 36.9% / Task Verification 21.3% — figures vary across secondary write-ups, verify against the primary paper before quoting; NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks track — arXiv:2503.13657). |
| Desktop or browser control | OS agent | Require sandboxing, UI verification, and action gating. |
| Code changes and CI feedback | SWE agent | Require repo isolation, tests, review gates, and rollback. |
| Autonomous improvement of code, prompts, or artifacts | Research / experiment agent | Fixed eval metric, bounded modification surface, keep/revert loop |

### Autonomous Improvement Loops

A research/experiment agent iterates autonomously: suggest a change → apply it → evaluate → keep or revert → repeat. The pattern works on anything with a measurable evaluation function.

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Modification surface** | What the agent can change | One file (`train.py`), one prompt, one config |
| **Eval function** | How to score the result | `val_bpb`, yes/no checklist (3-6 questions), latency measurement |
| **Keep/revert rule** | When to keep a change | Score improves; revert if it regresses |
| **Termination** | When to stop | N rounds, target score reached, or manual stop |
| **Ledger** | Experiment history | Git commits, results.tsv, changelog with reasoning |

Design constraints:
- Keep the modification surface small (one file, one prompt). Broader surfaces compound silent regressions.
- Use binary or scalar metrics, not subjective ratings. "Does the headline include a specific number?" beats "rate the headline quality 1-10."
- 3-6 eval criteria is the sweet spot. More causes gaming; fewer misses failure modes.
- Preserve the changelog — future models pick up where the last agent left off.

## Protocol Choice

| If the system needs... | Use |
| --- | --- |
| tool calls, database access, file access, prompts, resources | MCP |
| task handoffs, agent cards, multi-agent routing | A2A |
| both tools and collaborating agents | MCP + A2A |

Protocol defaults:

- Treat MCP as the tool/data integration layer, not as the agent architecture itself.
- Treat A2A handoffs as versioned APIs with schema validation and `trace_id` propagation.
- Prefer `stdio` or Streamable HTTP for MCP transports; treat older SSE-only guidance as compatibility material, not the default.
- For remote MCP, scope authorization and identity explicitly; do not rely on network trust alone.
- Known footgun: the official MCP SDK `stdio` interface has a by-design config→OS-command execution path (CVE-2026-30623; ~7k public servers exposed; Anthropic confirmed by-design and declined a protocol-level fix — input sanitization is the integrator's responsibility). Never pass untrusted server config into an `stdio` MCP launch; sandbox the MCP host process. Verified multi-source, April 2026.

## Agent-as-Code Pattern

Define agent personas as structured, versioned artifacts with explicit expertise, constraints, and expected outputs. This pattern treats agent definitions as reviewable code rather than ad-hoc prompt strings.

A well-defined agent spec includes:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Role** | What the agent is responsible for (e.g., "Architect", "QA reviewer") |
| **Expertise** | Domain knowledge and capabilities |
| **Constraints** | What it must not do, boundaries of authority |
| **Expected outputs** | Artifacts it produces (specs, reviews, plans, code) |
| **Interaction rules** | How it communicates with other agents or the human |

Benefits: agents can be reviewed in PRs, diffed between versions, and composed into teams with explicit role boundaries.

### Scale-Adaptive Agent Complexity

Match agent sophistication to task complexity. Do not use a full multi-agent orchestration for a bug fix, and do not use a single prompt for a platform migration.

| Task Complexity | Agent Approach |
|----------------|----------------|
| Config change, typo | Direct prompt, no agent infrastructure |
| Bug fix, small feature | Single agent with bounded tools |
| Multi-module feature | Lead + 2-3 specialized workers |
| Cross-service migration | Full orchestration with persona definitions, debate, and verification |

The decision to scale up should be driven by observed ambiguity, not assumed complexity.

## Production Defaults

- Keep state explicit, serializable, and replayable.
- **Externalize all state to files** — plan, progress, decisions, and dependency outputs persist in structured files so any agent session can resume without context inheritance.
- Keep tool surfaces narrow; publish tasks, not raw backend complexity.
- Bound retries, budgets, context size, and recursion depth.
- Treat retrieved/tool content as untrusted input.
- Instrument LLM calls, retrieval, memory ops, and tool calls with consistent tracing.
- Gate database writes, financial actions, legal/compliance actions, and destructive operations behind human approval.
- Prefer refusal or degraded mode over hidden unsafe fallbacks.

## Fact-Checking

- Known bugs, regressions, framework/compiler/runtime footguns, and version-specific crash or workaround guidance must be verified against current primary web sources before being treated as current fact.
- Verify current protocol specs, framework capabilities, release status, and vendor behavior before final answers.
- Prefer official docs, primary specifications, and first-party repos for fast-moving agent infrastructure claims.
- If a volatile claim cannot be checked, label it as unverified instead of presenting it as settled guidance.

## Trend Awareness Protocol

When users ask for:

- "best framework for X"
- "is X still relevant"
- "latest AI agent stack"
- pricing, version, or support-matrix questions
- MCP transport/auth guidance
- A2A ecosystem or vendor SDK recommendations

verify with web search and primary sources before answering.

Volatile areas to re-check every time:

- framework language support and lifecycle status
- MCP transport and authorization guidance
- OpenAI/Anthropic/Google pricing
- A2A ecosystem maturity and official docs
- vendor-specific tool, tracing, and handoff capabilities

If browsing is unavailable, use [`data/sources.json`](data/sources.json), say what is assumed, and avoid strong ranking claims.

## Usage Notes

- Start here for architecture and production posture, not for deep implementation walkthroughs.
- Prefer stable capability guidance over dated framework rankings.
- Load detailed references only after the user’s direction is clear.
- Keep recommendations operational: contracts, failure modes, gates, telemetry, and rollback.

## Learnings Loop

Before applying this skill on a non-trivial task, read `learnings.consolidated.md` in this directory (and `learnings.md` if present).

After applying it, if you encountered a pattern worth remembering, a mistake worth preventing, or a domain fact that surprised you, append one dated bullet to `learnings.md` via `agents-skills-feedback-loop/scripts/append_learning.py`. Do not modify `SKILL.md` itself.
