## Patterns That Work

## Mistakes to Avoid

- [2026-07-11] File-based memory has no lock/merge: two concurrent sessions in one working dir can silently clobber each other's AGENTS.md/MEMORY.md writes.
## Domain Knowledge

- [2026-08-21] Codex AGENTS.md can state workflow authorization, but approval reviewers, sandbox capabilities, and executable prefix decisions belong in config.toml, permission profiles, and .rules; auto-review grants no permissions.
- [2026-07-11] Anthropic's flagship line passed Opus 4.7/4.8: Claude Fable 5/Mythos 5 shipped 2026-06-09, Sonnet 5 shipped 2026-06-30. Re-verify model-generation claims every audit.
