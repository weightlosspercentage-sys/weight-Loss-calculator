# Statistical Analysis

## Overview

Statistical analysis is the systematic process of selecting appropriate tests, verifying assumptions, quantifying effect magnitudes, and reporting results. This knowhow guides test selection, assumption diagnostics, and APA-style reporting for frequentist and Bayesian analyses in academic research.

## Key Concepts

### Frequentist vs Bayesian Framework

| Aspect | Frequentist | Bayesian |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Core output | p-value, confidence interval | Posterior distribution, credible interval |
| Interpretation | "How likely is this data if H0 is true?" | "How likely is H1 given the data?" |
| Null support | Cannot support H0 (only fail to reject) | Can quantify evidence for H0 via Bayes Factor |
| Prior info | Not used | Incorporated via prior distributions |
| Sample size | Requires adequate power | Works with any sample size |
| Best for | Standard analyses, large samples | Small samples, prior info, complex models |

### Statistical vs Practical Significance

A statistically significant result (p < .05) may be trivially small in practice. Always report:
- **Effect size**: Magnitude of the effect (Cohen's d, eta-squared, r, R-squared)
- **Confidence interval**: Precision of the estimate
- **Context**: Clinical/practical relevance in the domain

### Common Effect Sizes

| Test | Effect Size | Small | Medium | Large |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| t-test | Cohen's d | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.80 |
| t-test (small n) | Hedges' g | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.80 |
| ANOVA | eta-squared partial | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 |
| ANOVA | omega-squared | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 |
| Correlation | r | 0.10 | 0.30 | 0.50 |
| Regression | R-squared | 0.02 | 0.13 | 0.26 |
| Regression | f-squared | 0.02 | 0.15 | 0.35 |
| Chi-square | Cramer's V | 0.07 | 0.21 | 0.35 |
| Chi-square 2x2 | phi coefficient | 0.10 | 0.30 | 0.50 |

Cohen's benchmarks are guidelines, not rigid thresholds -- domain context always matters.

### Assumptions Overview

Most parametric tests require:
1. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other
2. **Normality**: Data (or residuals) are approximately normally distributed
3. **Homogeneity of variance**: Groups have similar variances (for group comparisons)
4. **Linearity**: Relationship between variables is linear (for regression)

When assumptions are violated:
- **Normality violated, n > 30**: Proceed -- parametric tests are robust with large samples
- **Normality violated, n < 30**: Use non-parametric alternative
- **Variance heterogeneity**: Use Welch's correction (t-test) or Welch's ANOVA
- **Linearity violated**: Add polynomial terms, transform variables, or use GAMs

### Test-Specific Assumption Workflows

**T-test assumptions**: (1) Check normality per group with Shapiro-Wilk + Q-Q plots. (2) Check homogeneity with Levene's test. (3) If normality violated: Mann-Whitney U (independent) or Wilcoxon signed-rank (paired). If variance heterogeneity: use Welch's t-test.

**ANOVA assumptions**: (1) Normality per group. (2) Homogeneity via Levene's test. (3) For repeated measures: check sphericity (Mauchly's test); if violated, apply Greenhouse-Geisser (epsilon < 0.75) or Huynh-Feldt (epsilon > 0.75) correction. (4) If normality violated: Kruskal-Wallis (independent) or Friedman (repeated).

**Linear regression assumptions**: (1) Linearity via residuals-vs-fitted plot. (2) Independence via Durbin-Watson test (1.5-2.5 acceptable). (3) Homoscedasticity via Breusch-Pagan test + scale-location plot. (4) Normality of residuals via Q-Q plot + Shapiro-Wilk. (5) Multicollinearity via VIF (>10 = severe, >5 = moderate).

**Logistic regression assumptions**: (1) Independence. (2) Linearity of log-odds with continuous predictors (Box-Tidwell test). (3) No perfect multicollinearity (VIF). (4) Adequate sample size (10-20 events per predictor minimum).

### Specialized Test Categories

Beyond the main decision flowchart, several specialized test families address specific data types:

**Survival / time-to-event analysis**:
- **Log-rank test**: Compares survival curves between groups (non-parametric)
- **Cox proportional hazards**: Models time-to-event with covariates; assumes proportional hazards
- **Parametric survival models**: Weibull, exponential, log-normal for known distributional forms
- Use when outcome is time until an event (death, relapse, failure) with possible censoring

**Count outcome models**:
- **Poisson regression**: For count data where mean approximately equals variance
- **Negative binomial regression**: For overdispersed counts (variance > mean)
- **Zero-inflated models**: For excess zeros beyond what Poisson/NB predicts
- Use when outcome is a count (number of events, incidents, occurrences)

**Agreement and reliability**:
- **Cohen's kappa**: Inter-rater agreement for categorical ratings (2 raters)
- **Fleiss' kappa / Krippendorff's alpha**: Agreement for >2 raters
- **Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)**: Continuous ratings reliability
- **Cronbach's alpha**: Internal consistency of multi-item scales
- **Bland-Altman analysis**: Agreement between two measurement methods (continuous)
- Use when assessing measurement reliability or inter-rater consistency

**Categorical data extensions**:
- **McNemar's test**: Paired binary outcomes (2x2)
- **Cochran's Q test**: Paired binary outcomes (3+ conditions)
- **Cochran-Armitage trend test**: Ordered categories in contingency tables

## Best Practices

1. **Pre-register analyses** when possible to distinguish confirmatory from exploratory findings. Specify primary outcome, tests, and correction methods before data collection
2. **Always check assumptions before interpreting results**. Run normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk), homogeneity tests (Levene's), and residual diagnostics. Document results even when assumptions are met
3. **Report effect sizes with confidence intervals** for every test. p-values alone are insufficient -- effect sizes convey practical importance
4. **Report all planned analyses** including non-significant findings. Selective reporting inflates false positive rates
5. **Use appropriate multiple comparison corrections**. Bonferroni (conservative), Holm (step-down, less conservative), or FDR/Benjamini-Hochberg (for many tests). Choose based on the number of comparisons and acceptable error rate
6. **Visualize data before and after analysis**. Box plots for group comparisons, scatter plots for correlations, residual plots for regression diagnostics
7. **Conduct sensitivity analyses** to assess robustness: re-run with outliers removed, different transformations, or alternative tests
8. **Anti-pattern -- p-hacking**: Testing multiple outcomes, subgroups, or model specifications until p < .05 inflates false positives. Pre-register to avoid
9. **Anti-pattern -- HARKing** (Hypothesizing After Results are Known): Presenting exploratory findings as confirmatory undermines scientific integrity
10. **Anti-pattern -- misinterpreting non-significance**: Failure to reject H0 does not mean H0 is true. Use Bayesian methods or equivalence testing to support null

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Misinterpreting p-values as probability of the hypothesis being true**. p-values measure P(data | H0), not P(H0 | data). *How to avoid*: Use precise language: "If the null hypothesis were true, the probability of observing data this extreme is p = ..."

2. **Confusing statistical significance with practical importance**. A large sample can make trivially small effects significant. *How to avoid*: Always report and interpret effect sizes alongside p-values

3. **Running post-hoc power analysis after a non-significant result**. Post-hoc power is a mathematical function of the p-value and adds no new information. *How to avoid*: Use sensitivity analysis instead -- determine what effect size the study could detect at 80% power

4. **Ignoring assumption violations and proceeding with parametric tests**. *How to avoid*: Run assumption checks systematically. Use Welch's corrections, non-parametric alternatives, or transformations when violated

5. **Multiple comparisons without correction**. Running 20 tests at alpha = .05 gives ~64% chance of at least one false positive. *How to avoid*: Apply Bonferroni, Holm, or FDR correction. Report both corrected and uncorrected p-values

6. **Treating ordinal data as continuous**. Likert scales are ordinal -- means and standard deviations assume equal intervals. *How to avoid*: Use non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis) or ordinal regression

7. **Ignoring missing data patterns**. Listwise deletion assumes MCAR, which is rarely true. *How to avoid*: Assess missingness mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR). Use multiple imputation for MAR data

8. **Confusing correlation with causation**. Observational studies cannot establish causal relationships regardless of effect size. *How to avoid*: Use causal language only for experimental designs with random assignment

9. **Not reporting non-significant results**. Publication bias and file-drawer effect distort the literature. *How to avoid*: Report all pre-registered analyses. Consider registered reports

10. **Using one-tailed tests to "improve" significance**. One-tailed tests should be pre-specified based on strong directional hypotheses. *How to avoid*: Default to two-tailed. Only use one-tailed when justified a priori

## Workflow

### Standard Analysis Pipeline

1. **Define research question and hypotheses**
   - State H0 and H1 explicitly
   - Specify primary outcome and covariates

2. **Select statistical test** (use Decision Framework above)
   - Match test to data type, design, and assumptions
   - Plan multiple comparison corrections if needed

3. **Conduct a priori power analysis**
   - Specify target effect size (from literature or clinical relevance)
   - Set alpha = .05, power = .80 (minimum), determine required n
   - Libraries: `statsmodels.stats.power`, `pingouin`

4. **Inspect and clean data**
   - Check for missing data patterns (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)
   - Identify outliers (IQR method: Q1 - 1.5*IQR / Q3 + 1.5*IQR, or z-scores > 3)
   - Verify variable types and coding
   - The original `assumption_checks.py` script provides automated normality, homogeneity, and outlier detection with visualization

5. **Check assumptions** (see Test-Specific Assumption Workflows above)
   - Normality: Shapiro-Wilk test + Q-Q plots (visual primary for n > 50)
   - Homogeneity: Levene's test + box plots
   - Linearity: Residual plots (for regression)
   - Sphericity: Mauchly's test (for repeated measures)
   - Document results and remedial actions

6. **Run primary analysis**
   - Execute planned test with appropriate library (scipy.stats, pingouin, statsmodels)
   - Calculate effect size and confidence interval
   - For Bayesian analyses: specify priors, run MCMC, check convergence (see `references/bayesian_statistics.md`)

7. **Conduct post-hoc and secondary analyses**
   - Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD, Bonferroni)
   - Sensitivity analyses (remove outliers, alternative methods)
   - Exploratory analyses (clearly labeled)

8. **Report results in APA format**
   - Descriptive statistics (M, SD, n per group)
   - Test statistic, degrees of freedom, exact p-value
   - Effect size with confidence interval
   - See `references/reporting_standards.md` for templates
